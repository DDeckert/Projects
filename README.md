# My Projects

This repository is meant to showcase some of the research projects referenced in my CV. Some of my more academic projects have been collected in the subfolder labelled "Papers," while the more traditionally programming-intensive projects are represented in the subfolder labelled "Programming."

For any questions on projects not presented in this repository, I can be reached at *dominic.deckert@web.de*.
