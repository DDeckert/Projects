# Programming Projects

## Contents

This subfolder presents three example projects focusing on academic research from my studies. 

###  The Trolley Problem

As part of a study group on human reasoning, we attempted to model different philosophical (and psychological) approaches to the well-known Trolley problem. Presented here are presentation slides outlining our approach in the Weak Completion Semantics of three-valued logics. 

### Modeling the Curry Paradox

As a research project, I attempted to analyze survey data on human reasoning with regards to the Curry paradox of Philosophical Logic. Presented here is an internal paper analyzing these results and proposing a modeling in argumentation theory (in particular, ASPIC-END).

### Meta-Logical Reasoning

As my Diplom thesis, I analyzed discussion in the field of Philosophy of Logic and presented an initial idea how these discussions (and knowledge about logic in general) may be modeled using logic, in particular using structured argumentation theory in ASPIC-END.
