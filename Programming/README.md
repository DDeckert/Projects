# Programming Projects

## Contents

This subfolder showcases two example projects involving programming from my studies. They represent different challenges and therefore approaches to programming in research.

###  The Tabu Search project

As part of a study group on search algorithms and optimization, I implemented a Tabu search algorithm together with another student. The projnts ect is written in Python and represents a task where the focus was on the algorithmic solution.

### Representing the Description Logic Zoo

Building on earlier work by another student, I modelled the field of Description Logics - in particular, the relations between the different description logics and their reasoning complexities. This project uses Answer Set Programming (in particular, the language Clingo and the solver Clasp) to infer any results and relations between the different DLs. This project represents a model-centric programming task.
